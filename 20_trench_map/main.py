# originally, I was thinking to optimize this similar to the game of life
# where i keep track of the live/lit cells. Then only the lit cells and
# neighbours need to be considered for the calculation of the next step.
# This looked like it would work because the sample image enhancement
# algorithm had a dark/unlit for the 0th position.
# In the actual input it's 1! That means there are an infinite number of
# lit cells to track. That's not possible.
#
# Then I thought, what if I just compute the nth step recursively, without
# storing anything. I could hard code a bounding box and adjust it as needed
# until I get a decent looking result.
