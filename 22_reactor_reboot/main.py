# 2,758,514,936,282,235 entries won't fit into a set

# we need to recognize 1 coord intersects with 3 by 3
# so need to reduce the count by 1
# count is 8 so far

# need to recongize that
# a) 2,2 is off and we can turn that on
# b) 1,3 to 1,3 is already on minus the of
# so some how need to come up with incrementing by 1...?
# what if when processing the third cube, we look at each previous cube 1 by 1
# third cube is 3 by 3 so increment by 9
# so second cube, intersects on off , so increment by 1
# first cube incersects by 9 so decrement by 9
# overall we incremented by 1 as expected.
# lets try with another example to check

# on 2 to 4, 2 to 4

# step 1 (0):
#   cube is 3by3 so add 9
#   no cubes before it so no interesections
# step 2(9):
#   cube is 1 by 1 
#   intersects with 3 by 3 so decrement by 1
# step 3(8):
#  cube is 3 by 3 so add 9
#  intersects with off 1 by 1 so increment by 1
#  insersects with on 2by2 so decrement by 4
# 14
# what about double offs?
# o o
# o o
# then
# o o
# o . 
# then again
# o o
# o . 
# after step 2 we have 3
# intersect off 1by1 so increment by 1
# intersect on  1by1 so decrement by 1
# total delta is 0
# final result 3

# double off, no on

# intersect off 1by1 decrement by 1
# final result -1 ????
