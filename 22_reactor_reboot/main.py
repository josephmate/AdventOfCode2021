# for each cube in cubes:
#  for each intersecting_cube in split_cubes intersecting with cube:
#    remove intersecting_cube
#    split intersecting_cube based on cube
#    add the split back in
#  add cube into split_cubes
# now split_cubes only contains cubes that 100% overlap????
#   I'm not sure if this is true yet.
#   If the split cube is smaller than the cube, then the split cube won't
#   intersect. Then maybe we need to also split the cube as well?
# now split cubes only contains cube that 100% overlap

 ------------------

the last piece is calculating the intersection.
Let's try the 2D case first:
  0123456789 -> y
0 ooooo
1 o   o
2 o xxoxx
3 o x o x
4 ooooo x
5   x   X
6   xxxxx

v
x
Expected is x=(2,4) y=(2,4)

x1 = max(x1a, x1b) = max(0,2) = 2
x2 = min(x2a, x2b) = min(4,6) = 4
y1 = max(y1a, y1b) = max(0,2) = 2
y2 = min(y2a, y2b) = min(4,6) = 4

let's check what happens if they don't intersect:
  0123456
0 ooo xxx
1 o o x x
2 ooo xxx
Expected: something indicating no intersection

x1 = max(0,0) = 0
x2 = min(2,2) = 2
y1 = max(0,4) = 4
y2 = min(2,6) = 2

y1 > y2, which is not allowed, our rectangles are always
defined by x1 <= x2; y1 <= y2

so if x1 > x2 or y1 > y2 or z1 > z2, then there is no intersection

So for 3D the intersection should be:
x1 = max(x1a, x1b)
x2 = min(x2a, x2b)
y1 = max(y1a, y1b)
y2 = min(y2a, y2b)
z1 = max(z1a, z1b)
z2 = min(z2a, z2b)

x1 <= x2 and y1 <= y2 and z1 <= z2

|  Splitting Cubes |

 ------------------


now the hard part is to figure out how to split these cubes based on eachother

ooooo
o   o
o xxoxx
o x o x
ooooo x
  x   X
  xxxxx
When we split, we want only rectangles after we're done.
I think the easiest want to split would end up like this:
11333
11333
2244455
2244455
2244455
  66777
  66777

It looks like the cubes need to be split using the 'lines' x1, x2, y1, y2:
   x x x x
   1 1 2 2
   a b a b
   | | | |
   | | | |
---ooooo-+----y2a
   o   o |
---o xxoxx----y2b
   o x o x
---ooooo x----y1a
     x   x
-----xxxxx----y1b

Lets try a weird case where one corner is not within the other:
        ooooo
        o   o
     xxxoxxxoxxx
     x  o   o  x
     xxxoxxxoxxx
        o   o
        ooooo

        11111
        11111
     33344444555
     33344444555
     33344444555
        22222
        22222
It looks like it could work, but I'm not sure how to translate
this into code yet.
I also don't know how this translates to 3d yet.

Another way I can think of is to start with the intersection,
then consider the the rectangular prism
above, below, forward, back, left right:

ooooo
o   o
o xxoxx
o x o x
ooooo x
  x   X
  xxxxx

but that is not enough because up and left in the above example overlap.
So I think we need to consider the pairs:
2D
left up       up       right up
left     intersection  right
leff down     down     right down

3D
            | /
            |/
       -----+------
           /|
          / |

     --------
    /      / |
   /------/  |
   |      |  |
   |      | /
   |      |/
    ------/

looks like it would be a cross product of
up/down/none, left/right/none, forward/back/none
producing 27 squares
but none,none,none is the intersection so 26

but then I was think we could simplify this by
carefully handling the overlap:

back to 2d

ooooo
o   o
o xxoxx
o x o x
ooooo x
  x   X
  xxxxx

above the top of the intersection
below the bottom of the intersection
to the left of the intersection and below the top and above the bottom of the intersection
to the right of the intersection and below the top and above the bottom of the intersection
that reduces the number of rectangles we produce

in 3D it would be

     --------
    /      / |
   /------/  |
   |      |  |
   |      | /
   |      |/
    ------/

above the intersection
below the intersection
to the left  and below the top of the intersection
             and above the bottom of the instersection
to the right and below the top of the intersection
             and above the bottom of the instersection
forward      and below the top of the intersection
             and above the bottom of the instersection
             and to the right of the left of the intersection
             and to the left of the right of the intersection
backwards    and below the top of the intersection
             and above the bottom of the instersection
             and to the right of the left of the intersection
             and to the left of the right of the intersection

but how do these restrictions translate to code?

x is forward back
y is up down
z is left right

result must have x1 <= x2; y1 <= y2; z1 <= z2
if not, there is no sub shape there.

above the intersection
    y1 = intersection's y2
    y2 = y2 of shape
    x1,x2,z1,z2 stay the same
below the intersection
    y2 = intersection's y1
    y1 = y1 of shape
    x1,x2,z1,z2 stay the same

to the left  and below the top of the intersection and above the bottom of the intersection
z2 = intersection's z1 - 1
z1 remains the same
x1,x2 remain the same
need to collapse the y's since we already have cubes for them
y1 = max(y1, intersection's y1) # we cannot go below the intersection
    no need to add/subtract because the above/below had to remove it
    so we wouldn't double count the intersection
y2 = min(y2, intersection's y2) # we cannot go above the intersection
    no need to add/subtract because the above/below had to remove it
    so we wouldn't double count the intersection
similar for to the right

U = up    D = down    I = intersection
back  forward
<--   -->   ^
UUUUUUUUU   | up
   IIIFFF   
   IIIFFF
   IIIFFF   | down
DDDDDDDDD   v
rotate around the x axis (forward/back axis)

<--   -->   ^
RRRRRRRRR   | right
   IIIFFF   
   IIIFFF
   IIIFFF   | left
LLLLLLLLL   v

so we don't need to add/subtract like we need
to for the edge that touches the intersection
it's also not touching the already split cubes
as we can see from the above two diagrams

forwards
x1 = intersection's x2 + 1
x2 stays the same
y1 = max(y1, intersection's y1)
y2 = min(y2, intersection's y2)
z1 = max(z1, intersection's z1)
z2 = min(z2, intersection's z2)
similar for backwards
