# Amphipods will never stop on the space immediately outside any room.
#   They can move into that space so long as they immediately continue moving.
#   (Specifically, this refers to the four open spaces in the hallway that are
#    directly above an amphipod starting position.)
# Amphipods will never move from the hallway into a room unless that room is
#   their destination room and that room contains no amphipods which do not
#   also have that room as their own destination. If an amphipod's starting
#   room is not its destination room,
#   it can stay in that room until it leaves the room.
#   (For example, an Amber amphipod will not move from the hallway into the
#   right three rooms,
#   and will only move into the leftmost room if that room is empty or if it
#   only contains other Amber amphipods.)
# Once an amphipod stops moving in the hallway,
#   it will stay in that spot until it can move into a room.
#   (That is, once any amphipod starts moving,
#   any other amphipods currently in the hallway are locked in place and will
#   not move again until they can move fully into a room.)
